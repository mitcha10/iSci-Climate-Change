# Evaluation of "Shafting the Poor" by Willis Eschenbach

“Shafting the Poor”, written by Willis Eschenbach, discusses energy poverty in the context of climate change. Eschenbach provides current prices of electricity and gasoline throughout Europe and the US and discusses government policies implemented to increase these costs in an effort to decrease CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (Eschenbach, 2021).

Eschenbach argues that increases in energy prices are solely effective in perpetuating the gap between upper- and lower-class citizens. He states that low-income households allocate a substantial percentage of their income to paying for these goods and would no longer be able to afford them and other necessities with rising prices, resulting in energy poverty. In contrast, Eschenbach suggests that high-income households will continue to purchase gasoline and electricity at increased prices, producing minimal decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The data provided depicts that the country with the least expensive gasoline and electricity costs, the US, had the greatest per capita reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, indicating that increasing costs is ineffective in reducing emissions (Eschenbach, 2021).

Particular interest in this claim is due to its discussion of factors influencing climate change that are not typically discussed, like government decisions and the lifestyle that an individual’s socioeconomic status allows them to live. This article will be evaluated for its credibility and validity to determine if causality between these factors exists. 

This article’s author, Willis Eschenbach, has several published articles on “Watts Up With That?”, a popular blog for climate skeptics and alarmists, yet his profile does not include any information regarding his education or employment experience. Additional research established that Eschenbach received degrees in psychology and massage therapy, and works in construction, indicating that he is not educated in the field of climate change (DeSmog, n.d). In general, this blog is not peer-reviewed and encourages submissions from all individuals and viewpoints, regardless of credentials and validity of their claim—this, in itself, decreases the credibility of articles from this source. 

Furthermore, Eschenbach’s article does not include in-text citations, which is not uncommon for a blog intended for a lay audience, but it also does not include a list of references. By neglecting to include references, the credibility of an article is decreased, as the readers are not aware of the information’s origin. Although several statements within Eschenbach’s appear to be rooted in opinion and may not require a citation, he also does not include citations for the data or direct quotations within the article. 

With regard to the accuracy of Eschenbach’s claims, several more credible sources have provided evidence suggesting that aspects of this article are valid. The graphically represented data within this article appears to be consistent with global energy cost and CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction statistics collected by the International Energy Agency and University of Oxford, respectively (Ritchie and Roser, 2017; International Energy Agency, 2020). However, due to a lack of specific numerical data in Eschenbach’s article, it is difficult to precisely compare if his graphs depict legitimate data. Eschenbach’s claim that increased gasoline and electricity costs are ineffective in reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions possesses validity but is a generalization. Lee and Chong (2016) concluded that in the US, there is no causality between residential energy consumption and electricity costs, and therefore CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. However, they also show that there is immense variation between sectors and countries. Other research also demonstrates that electricity and gasoline costs in the US and Europe has resulted in energy poverty and food insecurity among low-income families, as Eschenbach described (Lynne Chester, 2014; Tuttle, 2017). 

Eschenbach’s contrary claim, suggesting that increasing electricity and gasoline prices are ineffective at reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and lead to energy poverty, are consistent with credible sources, but are presented in an uncredible manner.
