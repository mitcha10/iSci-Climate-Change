## Introduction 
Hamilton’s industrial history has resulted in air pollutants consistently being a concern, as they are linked to health-related impacts (Al-Dabbagh, 2011). We explore Hamilton’s contribution to this crisis by visualizing the trends in air pollutants over several years in three locations within the city. Current projects within the Hamilton community that aim to mitigate air pollution are also discussed. 

## Air Pollutants in Hamilton
There are three important pollutants that we will focus on: nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>).
